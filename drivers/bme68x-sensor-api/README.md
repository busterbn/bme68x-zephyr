# `drivers/bme68x-sensor-api` ─ BME68X Sensor API (Driver)

The [BME68X Sensor API] is an open source library provided by Bosch Sensortec, which covers configuration and control of BME680/688 sensors, as well as compensation of temperature, pressure, humidity and gas resistance values.

Most documented uses of BME680/688 sensors, including BSEC integration for Index for Air Quality (IAQ) and gas detection, assume that this library is available in some form, e.g. the [Bosch-BME68x-Library] for Arduino.

Porting this library essentially means providing the platform-specific communication interfaces (I2C/SPI) that the BME68X Sensor API implementation eventually relies on for accessing sensor registers.

In Zephyr context, this also requires integration with Devicetree, that is best addressed at the driver layer.

## API

Compatible devices (see [Compatible Devices](#compatible-devices)) are intended for use with the BME68X Sensor API, in particular:

- they don't provide the Zephyr [Sensors API]: this approach is covered by the upstream [BME680 driver], and the use cases considered here are those that we found impractical, if not impossible, to implement on top of the Sensors API
- the driver defines a single API entry point, `bme68x_sensor_api_init()`, which permits applications to *bind* BME68X Sensor API sensor instances to Zephyr device driver instances

Beside that, this driver follows Zephyr guidelines for multi-instance, multi-bus [Device Drivers].

It's automatically enabled when the devicetree contains compatible devices.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This driver *routes* all I2C/SPI communications through [System Calls]: the BME68X Sensor API is thus accessible from [User Mode] with the conventional restrictions.

## Compatible Devices

BME680/688 devices are represented by [Devicetree] nodes with compatible string `bosch,bme68x-sensor-api`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The use of "bosch" as vendor in this compatible string implies in no way that Bosch Sensortec endorses or promote this software: Bosch Sensortec is the vendor of the BME680/688 devices, not of this driver.
> See [Rules for vendor prefixes].

[Bindings]: https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/build/dts/bindings.html

### I2C

[Bindings] for BME680/688 sensors connected to [I2C buses] are defined in [`bosch,bme68x-sensor-api-i2c.yaml`].

Their communication interface is defined by the Zephyr base bindings for I2C devices ([`i2c-device.yaml`]), and the only required property is the device address on the bus (`reg`), e.g.:

``` dts
/* I2C bus the BME680/688 device is connected to. */
&i2c0 {
    bme680@76 {
        compatible = "bosch,bme68x-sensor-api";

        /* BME68X I2C slave address (0x76 or 0x77) */
        reg = < 0x76 >;
    };
};
```

[`i2c-device.yaml`]: https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/main/dts/bindings/i2c/i2c-device.yaml
[I2C buses]: https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/hardware/peripherals/i2c.html

### SPI

[Bindings] for BME680/688 sensors connected to [SPI buses] are defined in [`bosch,bme68x-sensor-api-spi.yaml`].

Their communication interface is defined by the Zephyr base bindings for SPI devices ([`spi-device.yaml`]).

SPI interfaces configuration requires to set at least the maximum SPI clock frequency of the device:

``` dts
/* SPI bus the BME680/688 is connected to. */
&spi3 {
    bme680@0 {
        compatible = "bosch,bme68x-sensor-api";
        reg = < 0 >;

        /* BME680/688 device maximum clock frequency (10 MHz) */
        spi-max-frequency = < 10000000 >;

        /*
         * Default: duplex = < 0 > == < SPI_FULL_DUPLEX >;
         */

        /*
         * Default: frame-format = < 0 > == < SPI_FRAME_FORMAT_MOTOROLA >;
         */

        /*
         * BME680/688 SPI interface supports SPI mode '00' (CPOL = CPHA = '0')
         * and mode '11' (CPOL = CPHA = '1').
         *
         * If not set: '00'.
         */
        spi-cpol;
        spi-cpha;
    };
};
```

## Kconfig

Software configuration is done with [Kconfig].

| [`Kconfig`](Kconfig)                           | Configuration                                              |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MY_BME68X_SENSOR_API_DRIVER`                     | Enable BME68X Sensor API (Driver)                          |
| `MY_BME68X_SENSOR_API_DRIVER_INIT_PRIORITY (=99)` | Relative initialization priority ([Initialization Levels]) |
| `MY_BME68X_SENSOR_API_DRIVER_LOG_LEVEL`           | Maximum log level                                          |

[Kconfig]: https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/build/kconfig/index.html
[Initialization Levels]: https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/kernel/drivers/index.html#initialization-levels

Configuration options are also accessible via the Kconfig menu: `Modules → bme68x → [*] BME68X Sensor API (Driver)`

> [!TIP]
>
> This driver and the BME68X Sensor API are automatically enabled when a device with "bosch,bme68x-sensor-api" bindings is connected to the devicetree.
