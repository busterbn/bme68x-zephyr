      Use the FILTER_FILTER filter to suppress short-term changes (e.g. slamming of door
	  or wind blowing into the sensor) in the environment.

	  The FILTER_FILTER effectively reduces the bandwidth of the temperature and pressure
	  output signals and increases the resolution of the output data to 20 bit,
	  noting that the humidity and gas values inside the sensor does not
	  fluctuate rapidly and does not require low pass filtering.

	  Low power (LP) mode is designed for interactive applications
	  where the air quality is tracked and observed at a higher update rate
	  of 3 seconds with a current consumption of <1 mA.

	  The corresponding heating profile is:
	  - temperature set-point: 320 degC

	  Ultra low power (ULP) mode is designed for battery-powered and/or
	  frequency-coupled devices over extended periods of time.
	  This mode features an update rate of 300 seconds
	  and an average current consumption of <0.1 mA.

	  The corresponding heating profile is:
	  - temperature set-point: 400 degC
	  - heating duration: 1943 ms
